## 🏗 Project Architecture

Fuente is structured as a **Cargo workspace** that manages multiple apps, each with its own dependencies and configurations. The main apps include:

- `admin/` - Dashboard for managing the platform.
- `business/` - Interface for businesses selling products or services.
- `consumer/` - Main shopping application for customers.
- `driver/` - App for delivery drivers.
- `fuente/` - Core shared resources and utilities.

Each app contains:
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies and settings.
- `manifest.json` - Web app metadata.
- `serviceWorker.js` - PWA functionality for offline capabilities.
- `Trunk.toml` - Configuration for Trunk bundler.
- `build.rs` - Custom build script if needed.
- `src/` - Main application logic.

Fuente does **not** rely on a traditional backend. Instead, it is fully decentralized, using **Nostr** and **IndexedDB** for communication and storage.

## 🌐 How Fuente Uses Nostr

Fuente leverages **Nostr** as its primary communication protocol for a trustless and decentralized experience. 

### 🔗 Communication with Relays
- All messages, transactions, and interactions are sent via **Nostr relays**, removing the need for centralized servers.
- Each app (consumer, business, admin, etc.) subscribes to specific events in the network, ensuring seamless interaction.

### 🔑 Authentication
- Users authenticate using **Nostr public/private keys** instead of traditional logins.
- Private keys are securely stored on the client-side, never exposing them to third parties.

### 💰 Payments & Transactions
- Bitcoin payments are processed using **BitcoinQR** and are confirmed via **Nostr events**.
- Transactions are immutable and verifiable, enhancing security and transparency.

### 📦 Data Storage
- No centralized database is used. Instead, **IndexedDB** is leveraged for local storage.
- Users retain control over their data, which can be synchronized across devices via Nostr relays.

Using **Nostr** ensures Fuente remains **censorship-resistant**, **fault-tolerant**, and **decentralized**, making it an ideal solution for borderless commerce.

## 📜 Contribution Guide
Thank you for your interest in contributing to Fuente! We follow a **GitFlow forking model**, similar to how Bitcoin development works. Below is the process for contributing.

### 1. Understanding the Contribution Model
This project follows a GitFlow forking model, inspired by how contributions are made to Bitcoin Core. Instead of pushing directly to the main repository, contributors fork the repository and submit changes via pull requests (PRs). Maintainers review, test, and merge contributions accordingly.

### 2.Prerequistes
Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) ⚙️
- [Rust & Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 🦀
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install) 🚀
- [WebAssembly Target](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) 🕸️
